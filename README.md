In the future, there will be binaries available. But for now, I'm not going to publish any as it would be pointless.

If you really want, you can compile it yourself, so here's some directions.

**Requirements:**

- [A rust compiler](https://rustup.sh)
- A terminal
- A functioning brain

Just run the following command in the repository: `cargo build --release`

It will take a little while, but once it's done, you should have a optimized binary ready for usage.
